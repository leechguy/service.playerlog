service.playerlog
=================

Log what you play and when you play it in a MySQL database.

Compatibility
-------------
* XBMC 13.0 Gotham


Prerequisites
-------------
* script.module.myconnpy v1.1.7 (or higher) must be installed.
* MySQL must be configured to allow access from hosts other than
  127.0.0.1 when it is not running on the same host.


Installation
------------
Unzip in your addon's directory either manually or install the addon from 
XBMC using the 'Install from zip file'-menu option in the 'Add-ons'-menu.

In your XBMC Addons directory (e.g. ~/.xbmc/addons) you will find the service.playerlog directory. In this directory open the 'createdb.txt'-file to find the instructions for creating the database in MySQL. This must be done manually, the plugin will not automatically create the database!


Configuration
--------------
Go to the 'Settings->Add-ons->Add-ons'-menu and select the 'Enabled Add-ons'-
menu option. Select 'Services' and then select'Playerlog Service'.
Select 'Configure'.
Configure your database connection.

Note: You need to configure this for every profile that you use!
